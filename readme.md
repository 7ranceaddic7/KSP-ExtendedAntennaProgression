Extended Antenna Progression
===

This mod adds long-range antennas using stock assets to facilitate communications networks for planet packs larger than the stock solar system. This allows the player to extend, rather than replace, the stock antenna progression, making long-range relays possible without trivializing inner-system communications.

- The RA-500 weighs 1.3 tons and has range rating of 500 Gm. It has a 1.25m bottom node and fits in a 5m fairing (i.e. it's a 2x rescaled RA-15.)
- The RA-2500 weighs 2.6 tons and has a range rating of 2.5 Tm. It has a 2.5m bottom node and fits in a 7.5m fairing (i.e. it's a 2x rescaled RA-100.)
- The RA-12500 weighs 5.2 tons and has a range rating of 12.5 Tm. It has a 2.5m bottom node and fits in a 10m fairing (i.e. its a 4x rescaled RA-15.)

As an incidental benefit, these antennas offer progressively better transmission performance than the stock relay antennas, particularly in terms of ElectricCharge consumed per Mit transmitted.

The enormous size of these antennas demands an unconventional approach to deployment. Possibilities include:

- Off-world manufacturing via mods such as [Extraplanetary Launchpads](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/54284-122-extraplanetary-launchpads-v571/), [OSE Workshop](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97537-12-ose-workshop-kis-addon-v110-20161103/), or [Ground Construction](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154167-122-ground-construction/).
- Oversized launch vehicles such as [AB Launchers](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/96141-11-ab-launchers-12-5m-energia-parts-22-apr/) (5m), [DIRECT](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117215-wip-112-direct-super-heavy-launchers-revamp-release/) (5m & 7.5m), or [SpaceY Lifters](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90545-122-spacey-heavy-lifter-parts-pack-v116-2017-01-30/)/[SpaceY Expanded](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/120012-121-spacey-expanded-v131-2016-11-03/) (5m, 7.5m, & 10m). To facilitate the simultaneous launch of multiple satellites, this mod adds stock fairings (including interstage trusses) resized to 5m, 7.5m, and 10m diameters.
- In case none of the above appeal to you, compact deployable versions of all three antennas are provided (via rescaling of the Communotron 88-88 to 0.625m, 0.9375m, and 1.25m.)

As the new antennas are substantially more powerful than the stock Deep Space Network, three additional levels of the Tracking Station are provided via the [Custom Barn Kit](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/109027-122-custom-barn-kit-1111-mar-11th-no-instruction-leaflet-edition/) (not included.) These allow the player to choose between launching local relays or simply boosting the DSN.

- Level 4 of the Tracking Station costs 2,111,000 Funds and boosts the DSN's range rating to 1.25 Tm.
- Level 5 of the Tracking Station costs 7,916,000 Funds and boosts the DSN's range rating to 6.25 Tm.
- Level 6 of the Tracking Station costs 29,685,000 Funds and boosts the DSN's range rating to 31.25 Tm.

This presents alternatives at several performance points to the excellent [JX2 Large Deployable Antenna](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/153125-122-jx2antenna-v11-giant-1000g-antenna-for-big-solar-systems/). These parts are generally cheaper and less massive than the JX2 for their range with the trade-off of being much bulkier and far less visually distinctive.

As a bonus, I've included a half-scale version of the RA-2 antenna that has the stats of the HG-5. This alternate handle-free form factor for the HG-5 fits better on compact probe assemblies as small as 0.3125m. Also included for launching miniature relays is a 0.625m fairing; I recommend [RLA Stockalike](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/152140-121-rla_continued-140/) for 0.625m launch vehicles.

## Installation & Requirements

To install, copy the ExtendedAntennaProgression folder to your GameData folder. The optional files in the Extras folder may be installed in the same way.

This mod requires ModuleManager (not included.) Custom Barn Kit is required for the extended tracking station progression, but otherwise optional.
