Extended Antenna Progression
===

This mod adds long-range antennas using stock assets to facilitate communications networks for planet packs larger than the stock solar system. This allows the player to extend, rather than replace, the stock antenna progression, making long-range relays possible without trivializing inner-system communications.

As an incidental benefit, these antennas offer progressively better transmission performance than the stock relay antennas, particularly in terms of ElectricCharge consumed per Mit transmitted.

As the new antennas are substantially more powerful than the stock Deep Space Network, additional levels of the Tracking Station are provided via the [Custom Barn Kit](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/109027-122-custom-barn-kit-1111-mar-11th-no-instruction-leaflet-edition/) (not included.) These allow the player to choose between launching local relays or simply boosting the DSN.

As a bonus, I've included a half-scale version of the RA-2 antenna that has the stats of the HG-5. This alternate handle-free version for the HG-5 fits better on compact probe assemblies as small as 0.3125m.

## Installation & Requirements

To install, copy the ExtendedAntennaProgression folder to your GameData folder.

This mod requires ModuleManager (not included.) Custom Barn Kit is required for the extended tracking station progression, but otherwise optional.

## Recommended Mods

The following mods are not required, but are suggestions to make launching relays easier:

- Large relays: [Near Future Launch Vehicles](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155465-16x-near-future-technologies-16x-fixes-jan-21/)
- Tiny relays: [Restock+](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/182679-161-restock-revamping-ksps-art-march-10-bugfixes/)

Compact deployable versions of all large relay antennas are included as an alternative to large launchers.
